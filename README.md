Hello everyone, 

I am posting here the projects relating some data analysis with python libraries mainly as (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly..)

Later i will be doing some map related projects using folium.

Ideas for the projects are mine, databases I'm taking from public repositories.

Besides python, I will have later on other folders for projects related to: SQL (MySQL, DB Browser mainly), Excel and others.

As in the future I would like to go for an Data Analyst role, I am playing around with some data manupulation and data visualization tecniques.

I could be uploading new version of the projects from time to time, as some ideas might occur. I would like to apply some machine learning models to those databases as well.

Peace and love!
Oscar
