Hello everyone, 

I am posting here the projects relating some data analysis with python mainly. 

Ideas for the projects are mine, databases I'm taking from public repositories.

As in the future I would like to go for an Data Analyst role, I am playing around with some data manupulation and data visualization tecniques.

Peace and love!
Oscar
